        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer who is proficient in JavaScript, HTML,
          CSS, SQL and testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha and cypress.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently working as a freelance developer building sites for
          small local companies and as a part-time mentor, helping coding
          bootcamp students at Lighthouse Labs. I am also on the look out for
          full-time opportunities. Prior to this I developed several apps, some
          of which I have highlighted in the projects page.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside coding my interests include exercise and nutrition, sports and
          aviation.
