        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer, looking for an entry-level position at a
          great company to be a hard-working asset to the team, to learn, grow
          and develop long-term. I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
          and testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha and cypress.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently using my talents as a freelance developer building
          sites for small local companies and as a part-time mentor, helping
          coding bootcamp students at Lighthouse Labs. Prior to this I developed
          several apps, some of which I have highlighted in the projects page.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am quitely confident, goal driven and love to find new way to
          challenge myself. Outside coding my interests include exercise and
          nutrition, sports and aviation.
